A Prometheus Exporter for Mikrotik devices. Can be configured to collect
metrics from a single device or multiple devices. Single device monitoring
can be configured all on the command line. Multiple devices require a
configuration file. A user will be required that has read-only access to the
device configuration via the API.

Currently the exporter collects metrics for interfaces and system resources.
Others can be added as long as published via the API.
